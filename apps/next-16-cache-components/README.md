# Next.js 16 with Playwright

This project demonstrates how to use `next-public-env` with Next.js 16 and Playwright.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Install the Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   pnpm playwright install
   ```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

This will build the Next.js application, start the server, and then run the Playwright tests.
